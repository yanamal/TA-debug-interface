        <h2>CSE Teaching Assistant Study</h2>
        <div>
            Thank you for participating in our study!

            In this study, you will take on the role of a Teaching Assistant in an introductory Python programming class.
            You will be using a web interface to help students debug their code.
            On each screen, you will see the problem statement for a programming problem, and a student's incorrect solution to that problem.
            You will be asked to fix the student code, then write an explanation of what was wrong with it.
            Please do this for as many problems as you can within the time limit.
        </div>
        <!--
        This is meant to imitate student/TA interaction in office hours or email: helping, not testing.
        write an explanation of what was wrong with it *to help the student*

        Feel free to use any resources you would normally use when helping a student debug their code

        The automatically generated solution passes unit tests, but may not be optimal
        -->
        <div>
            Before you begin, please answer the following questions about your background and experience.
        </div>
        <div>
            After one hour, you will also answer a few follow-up questions about the interface you were using.
